# Prim's Algorithm

This is an implementation of Prim's algorithm in Java. The algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph. 

## Usage

The code consists of two files:

1. `PrimAlgo.java`: The main Java file containing the implementation of Prim's algorithm.
2. `README.md`: This readme file providing information about the code.

To use the Prim's algorithm implementation, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `PrimAlgo.java` file.
3. Compile the Java file using the following command:

   ```
   javac PrimAlgo.java
   ```

4. Run the compiled Java class using the following command:

   ```
   java PrimAlgo
   ```

   The program will execute and display the minimum spanning tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm for the given graph.

## Graph Representation

The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix. The weight of each edge between nodes is specified in the matrix. The provided code includes a sample adjacency matrix for a graph with 20 nodes.

## Output

The program will output the minimum spanning tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm. The output format shows the nodes and their respective cumulative weights as they are added to the MST. For example:

```
A (0), B (5), Q (9), T (13), U (14), K (20), M (21), L (23), S (26), E (37), Z (39), D (51), P (53), G (64), F (67), N (68), H (70), J (72), Y (74),
```

This indicates that the minimum spanning tree includes edges connecting nodes A to B, B to Q, Q to T, T to U, U to K, and so on, with the cumulative weights shown in parentheses.
